        <h1>Time</h1>
        <p>There are three words in Malay that mean <i>"time"</i>. Each has a slightly different meaning:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <b>Masa</b>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Time that is quantifiable (e.g., plenty of time, not enough time, a little time). In colloquial
                    Malay, <i>Masa</i> and <i>Waktu</i> are used interchangeably. However, when in doubt use
                    <i>Masa</i>.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <b>Waktu</b>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Used for naming time (e.g., <span class=hl>Waktu Makan</span> is <i>Meal Time</i> and <span
                        class="hl">Waktu Kerja</span> is <i>Work Time</i>)
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <b>Pukul</b>
                </td>
                <td>
                    Used for <i>"o'clock"</i> (e.g., <span class="hl">Pukul Lima</span> is <i>"Five o'clock"</i>).
                    Literally translates to <i>"to strike"</i>. <i>Pukul</i> is <b>not</b> interchangeable with
                    <i>Masa</i> or <i>Waktu</i> is this context.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            <b>Masa</b> can also be used to demonstrate "when X" or "while X". For example, "When I was in London" is
            <span class="hl">Masa saya di London</span> and "While I was looking at him" is <span class="hl">Masa saya
                tengok dia</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional vocabulary:
        </p>
        <table id="tblTime">
        </table>
        <!-- Additional Notes -->
        <p>
            <span class="hl">Suku</span> is used to mean <i>"Quarter past"</i>. For example <span class="hl">Lima
                Suku</span> is <i>Quarter past Five</i>. 5:45, or <i>Quarter to Six</i> is <span class="hl">Pukul Lima
                Tiga Suku</span> which can be interpreted as three quarter pasts (3 x 15 = 45) - although this approach
            is not often used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way to say <i>Minutes to Hour</i> (e.g., Quarter to Seven) is using the format <span
                class="hl">Kurang [minutes to] pukul [next hour] </span>. Quarter to Seven becomes <span
                class="hl">Kurang suku pukul tujuh</span>. Note that <i>suku</i> can be used instead of fifteen (<i>Lima
                belas</i>).
