        <p>
            In Malay, you can place questions words at either the beginning or at the end of a sentence. For example,
            <em>"Why did he go?"</em> can be either:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Kenapa</b> dia pergi?</li>
            <li>Dia pergi <b>kenapa</b>?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>"What is that?"</em> can be either:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Apa</b> tu? <em>(Tu is a shortened form of "Itu" meaning 'that')</em></li>
            <li>Tu <b>apa</b>?</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- ## -->
        <!-- TAK -->
        <h2>Tak</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="hl">Tak</span> is a shortened form of <em>Tidak</em>, meaning <em>No</em>. When <em>Tak</em> is
            placed at the end of a sentence it denotes that the sentence is a question. It is comparable to starting a
            question in English with <em>"Do...?"</em> or ending a question with <em>"...or not?"</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, <em>"Do you sell toothpaste?"</em> in Malay is <em>Ada jual ubat gigi <b>tak</b>?</em>
        </p>
        <!-- KE AND KAN-->
        <h2>Ke and Kan</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="hl">Ke</span> and <span class="hl">Kan</span> can be placed at the end of a sentence to turn a
            statement into a question. These can be use useful as they signify that a quesiton is being asked regardless
            of the tone used.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the statement <em>Nak makan</em> means <em>"want to eat"</em> but <em>"Nak makan
                <span class="hl">ke?</span>"</em> becomes the question <em>"Do you want to eat?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The difference between <em>Ke</em> and <em>Kan</em> is that <em>Kan</em> is used for questions where the
            asker expects the other person to agree with them. It is comparable to adding <em>"...right?"</em> to the
            end of a question is English. For example, <em>"Nak makan <span class="hl">kan?</span>"</em> can be
            translated as
            <em>"You want to eat, right?"</em>.
